## LLM
A large language model (LLM) is a language model trained with self-supervised machine learning on a vast amount of text, designed for natural language processing tasks, especially language generation.

The largest and most capable LLMs are generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), which are largely used in generative chatbots such as ChatGPT, Gemini or Claude.

## Gen-AI and LLM

The text you provide to a language model is called a ***prompt***. The
prompt is given to the model, which then generates an answer.
The result produced by the model is known as a ***completion***, and
the process of using the model to generate text is called ***inference***.

LLMs deal with large and complex data sets. By representing these
data sets in vector form, where words are represented by numbers in a multidimensional space, it becomes easier for the models to compare and analyze information. ***Vector*** databases store
data as mathematical representations that can be easily parsed
by ML models. These vector “***embeddings***” are the most efficient
way to process and store quantitative representations of natural language.

***AI agents*** are simply individual instances of language models that are responsible for performing specific tasks, such as text
summarization, language translation, and sentiment analysis.
They’re coordinated and managed within an orchestration system to complete complex language processing tasks. This process,
known as orchestration, involves organizing agents, coordinating
the input/output of various models, and managing the flow of data
and information among agents. For example, in an e-commerce
scenario, a chatbot interacting with a customer might use
AI agents to retrieve order details from a database, generate a
request for a return label using a shipping partner’s API, confirm
the customer’s information, and initiate the return process by
sending a shipping label.
